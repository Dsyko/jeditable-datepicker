# jeditable-datepicker

Jeditable plugin to enable jQuery UI Datepicker input fields.

## Background

Jeditable is probably the best inline editing plugin for jQuery. It works with several types of input fields out of the box, like text fields and text area fields. You can write your own plugins for Jeditable to support other type of input fields (yes, plugins for the plugin). The jeditable-datepicker enables inline editing for jQuery UI Datepicker.

## Usage

## Installation

Put jquery.jeditable.datepicker.js in your project.

Of course, this assumes you are already using jQuery, jQuery UI, and Jeditable.
